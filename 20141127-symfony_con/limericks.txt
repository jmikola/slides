annotations everywhere
MVC, HTML in the model
sending email from templates
writing your app in yaml
indentation
sfContext::container facade
url shortener compression
caching page as image with image maps




(Ryan)
In the rush to build the next snapchat
My controllers got bloated and quite fat
So I asked the great fabpot
Who then told me to fear not
Moving logic to Twig fixes all that

(Jeremy)
These service configs are like cancer
There must be some DI enhancer
But then a gift from God
Taylor Otwell's facade
sfContext::container()'s the answer

(Jeremy)
We outsourced to devs to Timbuktu
But the code we neglected to review
They used two tabs and a space
Now our code's out of place
We should have just stuck with PSR-2

(Ryan)
In Varnish you still have to process
And that leads to performance losses
To get the most of out of me
The great PHP
Cache a screenshot, it will be the fastest

(Magnus)
Finding controllers is a disaster
Storing them elsewhere is surely faster
In routing.yaml
InTheCaseOfCamel
Eval them and you'll be the master

(Jeremy)
I can seldom resist the temptations
To write logic within annotations
ExpressionLanguage is handy
Oh its features are dandy
Just perfect for Doctrine hydrations

(Magnus)
To set PHP apart from the rest
Inlining some code's a request
Visual Basic was chosen
The change set was frozen
Our inner vision can now be expressed
